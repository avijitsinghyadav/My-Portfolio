<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Avijit Singh Yadav, and I recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Kota.
   I successfully finished a 6-month internship at Amazon, where I collaborated with the Aurora Storage team.
    During this time, I not only completed my project but also delivered end-to-end results. I developed
     a comprehensive Database Consistency Checking (DBCC) tool designed for Replicated tables in the latest
      Kermit Aurora Database framework. This tool ensures the consistency of data and schema, covering columns
       and constraints.</p>

<p>My time at Amazon equipped me with diverse technical skills, including proficiency in Git, Microsoft Outlook,
   Jira, Sage, Quip, Design Inspector, and Debugger. Additionally, I honed leadership skills such as time management,
    teamwork, frugality, and a proactive bias for action.</p>

<p>
  In my college years, I authored a research paper titled "Automated Diagnosis of Dysgraphia using Machine Learning
   Algorithm," now published by Springer. I've also undertaken personal projects, one of which involved creating an
    application using Java.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond this, I possess a strong foundation in C++/C, Data Structures, algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
   concepts, Database Management Systems, and Basic Java.
